# META Ad Set Performance Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, I have analyzed the performance of 17 ad sets from a fictional clothing company's Meta ads account over a period of two months. The dataset encompasses the performance metrics of different types of ad sets, segmented by various factors such as age, gender, placements, region, and time. Each data segmentation is presented in a separate tab, totaling five tabs for comprehensive analysis.

**[Download the Excel file here](Meta_Ad_Analysis.xlsx)** to explore the raw data and analysis in detail.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - The data was cleaned to remove duplicates, ensuring accuracy.
   - All data was formatted as tables and integrated into data models for efficient analysis.

2. **Metric Calculation**
   - Measures were created to calculate key performance metrics, including:
     - **CPC** (Cost Per Click)
     - **CPM** (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)
     - **CTR** (Click-Through Rate)
     - **AOV** (Average Order Value)
     - **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend)

3. **Overall Ad Set Performance**
   - The overall performance of the ad sets was assessed using pivot tables to identify the best and worst performing ad sets.

4. **Granular Analysis**
   - A more granular analysis was conducted by breaking down the ad set names to extract different features, such as targeting method, user type, gender type, product type, and ad location, for deeper insights.

5. **Performance Across Cuts**
   - Detailed analysis was performed on ad performance across various cuts, such as age, gender, placement, and more.

6. **Pivot Tables and Charts**
   - In each tab, pivot tables and pivot charts were created, supplemented with slicers for enhanced data exploration.

7. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Each tab includes insights and actionable recommendations to improve ad performance based on the analysis.

## Analysis and Key Insights

### Advertisement Performance at Adset Level
Since the most relevant performance information, including purchase conversion value, is found in the AgeGender and Placement tabs, they were used to assess ad set performance. The best and worst-performing ad sets are:

1. **Best-performing ad set**: Sales_LookAlike_Purchase_NewUser_AllIndia_AllGenders_Tops – The lowest CPA (413), along with low CPC (24) and CPM (218), and high CTR (0.9), resulted in the highest ROAS (2).
2. **Worst-performing ad set**: Sales_Interest_Purchase_NewUser_AllIndia_Female_Skirts – Despite a relatively low AOV (1138), the highest CPA (2760) led to a poor ROAS (0.4).

Key insights from the analysis include:
- **Lookalike audiences** outperform interest-based targeting, leading to lower CPC and CPM and higher ROAS.
- **New User campaigns** have higher ROAS despite higher CPA compared to remarketing efforts.
- **All India campaigns** show better cost efficiency, reducing CPC, CPM, and CPA, improving overall ROAS.
- **Gender-specific targeting** underperforms compared to all-gender ads due to higher CPA.
- **Product targeting matters**: Tops outperform other products due to a low CPA and consistent ROAS.

### Gender and Age Group Insights
- **Female-targeted ads** show high engagement (CTR 0.84) and cost-efficiency (CPA 554), while **male-targeted ads** need creative improvements due to lower CTR and higher costs.
- **35-44 age group** has the best ROAS (1.8) and lowest CPA (505), warranting further investment.
- **55-64 age group** shows potential with high AOV (1265), making upselling strategies effective.

### Platform and Placement Insights
- **Desktop ads** convert well, with a ROAS of 2.2, despite higher costs, indicating higher purchasing intent.
- **Facebook Reels Overlay** is a standout placement, with a ROAS of 16.8 and extremely low CPC and CPA.
- **Messenger and Audience Network** should be prioritized due to low CPA and strong ROAS.

### Time of Day Insights
- Morning ads (6:00 AM – 1:00 PM) perform best due to higher user engagement and competitive bidding.
- Midday (12:00 PM – 12:59 PM) has the highest CTR (0.88%), indicating a prime window for high-impact ads.
- Evening ad spend should be reduced due to declining engagement after 5:00 PM.

### Regional Insights
- **Northeastern states** offer cost-effective ad opportunities with lower CPC and CPM compared to major states.
- **Delhi and Chandigarh** have high CTRs and engagement, justifying an increase in ad spend.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the ability to analyze and interpret ad performance data, providing valuable insights to enhance advertising strategies. Through this analysis, several actionable insights were discovered that could optimize Meta ad campaigns. The use of data-driven decision-making is crucial in identifying high-performing elements such as audience segments, product targeting, placements, and time-based strategies, all of which contribute to maximizing advertising effectiveness and returns.
