# META Ad Set Performance Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, I have analyzed the performance of 17 ad sets from a fictional clothing company's Meta ads account over a period of two months. The dataset encompasses the performance metrics of different types of ad sets, segmented by various factors such as age, gender, placements, region, and time. Each data segmentation is presented in a separate tab, totaling five tabs for comprehensive analysis.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - The data was cleaned to remove duplicates, ensuring accuracy.
   - All data was formatted as tables and integrated into data models for efficient analysis.

2. **Metric Calculation**
   - Measures were created to calculate key performance metrics, including:
     - **CPC** (Cost Per Click)
     - **CPM** (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)
     - **CTR** (Click-Through Rate)
     - **AOV** (Average Order Value)
     - **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend)

3. **Overall Ad Set Performance**
   - The overall performance of the ad sets was assessed using pivot tables to identify the best and worst performing ad sets.

4. **Granular Analysis**
   - A more granular analysis was conducted by breaking down the ad set names to extract different features, such as targeting method, user type, gender type, product type, and ad location, for deeper insights.
     
5. **Performance Across Cuts**
   - Detailed analysis was performed on ad performance across various cuts, such as age, gender, placement, and more.

6. **Pivot Tables and Charts**
   - In each tab, pivot tables and pivot charts were created, supplemented with slicers for enhanced data exploration.

7. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Each tab includes insights and actionable recommendations to improve ad performance based on the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the ability to analyze and interpret ad performance data, providing valuable insights to enhance advertising strategies. The structured approach taken throughout the analysis emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in marketing efforts.
